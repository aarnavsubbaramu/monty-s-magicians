5 sentence summary for app to book spaces on campus

1. introduction: On university campus, there are a lot of open-door and closed-door events happening through the day and some late into night that need spaces to be booked way before. 
2. related work: Many room booking systems, like classroombookings, Roomzilla, and Google Calendar are administration oriented and often lack user-friendly features for people booking spaces and do not want to worry about potential conflicts. They are organised such that event becomes the object around which the interface is organised.
3. problem statement: We need a software that puts the user's ease in mind, in terms of making booking process as light as possible in terms of cognitive load.
4. solution or proposal: We propose to tie each booking to a user's unique university email id, so that there is transparency of who booked a given space (i.e., this information is available to the entire university), for how long and for what purpose. By doing this we offer a one-place solution that helps with better informational flow regarding spaces and occupancy
5. validation: We can validate the completion of the project when and if there can be room booings without any conflict and the information is very clearly.


Project Approach
Our project is organized by first breaking down each major component, such as UI/UX design and the web application, into smaller, manageable tasks. Each of these components is further subdivided into specific parts for easier implementation.

To kick things off, we brainstormed potential ideas while identifying our limitations, and then each team member selected a task based on their expertise and interests.

We hold two full-team meetings per week to ensure everyone stays aligned, with additional meetings taking place between members working on related tasks.

For version control and collaboration, we use a GitHub repository. Each team member works on their tasks by forking the main repository and committing changes through pull requests to ensure smooth integration.
