5 sentence summary for app to book spaces on campus

1. introduction: On university campus, there are a lot of open-door and closed-door events happening through the day and some late into night that need spaces to be booked way before. 
2. related work: Many room booking systems, like classroombookings, Roomzilla, and Google Calendar are administration oriented and often lack user-friendly features for people booking spaces and do not want to worry about potential conflicts. They are organised such that event becomes the object around which the interface is organised.
3. problem statement: We need a software that puts the user's ease in mind, in terms of making booking process as light as possible in terms of cognitive load.
4. solution or proposal: We propose to tie each booking to a user's unique university email id, so that there is transparency of who booked a given space (i.e., this information is available to the entire university), for how long and for what purpose. By doing this we offer a one-place solution that helps with better informational flow regarding spaces and occupancy
5. validation: We can validate the completion of the project when and if there can be room booings without any conflict and the information is very clearly.
